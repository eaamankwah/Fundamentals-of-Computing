# Fundamentals-of-Computing

# Overview
[Fundamentals of Computing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals) covers much of the material that first-year Computer Science students take at Rice University. Students learn sophisticated programming skills in Python from the ground up and apply these skills in building more than 20 fun projects. The Specialization concludes with a Capstone exam that allows the students to demonstrate the range of knowledge that they have acquired in the Specialization. The courses are taught from Rice University,Texas through [Coursera platform](https://www.coursera.org).

This Specialization covers:

* Recursion * Algorithms * Python Programming * Dynamic Programming
* Programming Principles * Python Syntax And Semantics * Computer Programming
* Logic Programming * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) * Combinatorics
* Tree (Data Structure) * Graph Theory
